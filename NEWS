BatchJobs_1.1-1135:
- Increased minor version number
- Added support for SLURM schedulers
- Function getErrors renamed to getErrorMessages due to conflicts with RUnit.
  Interface change: argument "print" dropped
- Redefined return value of function "waitForJobs" which should now be much easier to understand.
- New option "BatchJobs.check.posix" to enable more relaxed checks on file and directory names
- Helper functions to simplify integration into other packages: getConfig, loadConfig and setConfig.
  showConf was replaced with a print generic.
- Improved stability and speed of killJobs
- Added a workaround to fix file URI handling on windows
- Many minor bug and documentation fixes
- The registry now supports an "exports" directory of exported objects,
  which are always loaded on the slaves, e.g. data objects which are needed in every job
  This directory can be either managed manually or - more  conveniently - via the "fail" package on CRAN.
- The registry now supports a list of source directories. 
  All R files in these subdirectories are sourced on the slaves (and also on the master)
  Nice if you have a lot of helper code in seperate R files which is needed in your jobs.
- batchMap and all result functions where this is reasonable support naming results with the names
  of the elements that were mapped over (see use.names argument)
- batchMap now supports mapping over any kind of object (not only lists and vectors) that supports the 
  "length" and "[" / "[["- index method. 

BatchJobs_1.0-966:
- Dropped support for R < 2.13.0 (.find.packages deprecated)
- speedups in reduceResults[ReturnValue]
- Output of showStatus now contains a time information
- fixed a bug in findErrors (argument 'ids' was ignored)
- New function sweepRegistry: Remove intermediate/temporary/obsolete files
- Better error handling in case of I/O errors
- New functions: findStarted() and findNotStarted()

BatchJobs_1.0-915:
- new option to raise warnings to errors on the slaves 
- option to set process priority via nice in clusterFunctionsMulticore and 
  clusterFunctionsSSH
- new helper functions: getErrors, getJobInfo, loadConfig, callFunctionOnSSHWorkers, getSSHWorkersInfo,
  installPackagesOnSSHWorkers, waitForJobs, several more find* functions
- removed helper getJobTimes -> this is included in getJobInfo
- experimental file-based caching mechanism to speed up the processing of queries generated on computational nodes
- various smaller fixes
- documentation fixes

BatchJobs_1.0-606: 
- many dependencies are now imports
- many fixes and improvements for stability in cluster functions
- helper functions for your own cluster functions are exported and documented, they all start with cf*
- interactive mode now has dummy functions for listing and killing jobs
- interactive mode now generates log files
- job resources (from submits) are stored and can be queried on the master and the slaves 
  (see getResources and getJobResources) 
- defaults for job resources can be specified in config file, see config part on web page
- multicore and SSH mode now supports r.options, i.e. options to start Rscript and R CMD BATCH with   
- function grepLogs to search log files for a pattern

BatchJobs_1.0-527: 
- very minor bug fixes: for argument conversion and checks

BatchJobs_1.0-485: 
- First submit to CRAN.
